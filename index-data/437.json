To evaluate this usefulness, we measured TG mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control. Surprisingly, we detected TG mRNA in all samples obtained after total thyroidectomy, including those from 4 medullary carcinomas. Further, there was no statistical difference in expression levels of TG mRNA in the patients with or without metastasis, and no significant correlation was found between serum TG concentrations and the expression levels of TG mRNA. These results give rise to a question regarding the clinical applications of not only RT-PCR detection but also quantitative measurement of TG mRNA in peripheral blood.
