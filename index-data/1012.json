The severity of disease and spread of this epidemic virus present a serious public health threat in the absence of vaccines or anti-viral therapies. Here, we describe a novel vaccine that protects against emerging CHIKV infection of non-human primates (NHP). We show that selective expression of viral structural proteins gives rise to virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro that resemble replication-competent alphaviruses. Immunization with these VLPs elicited neutralizing antibodies against envelope proteins from different CHIKV strains. Monkeys immunized with VLPs produced high titer neutralizing antibodies that protected against viremia after high dose challenge. We transferred these antibodies into immunodeficient mice, where they protected against subsequent lethal CHIKV challenge, establishing a humoral mechanism of protection. Immunization with alphavirus VLP vaccines represents a strategy to contain the spread of CHIKV and related pathogenic viruses in humans."],"authors":["Wataru Akahata","Zhi-yong Yang","Hanne Andersen","Siyang Sun","Heather A.

We amplified plasmids encoding the polyproteins E3, E2, 6K, and E1 by PCR using sense primer 5′-GCTCTAGACACCATGAGCCTCGCCCTCCCGGTCTTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGGATCCTCATTAGTGCCTGCTAAACGACA-3′ (37997) and sense primer 5′-GCTCTAGACACCATGAGTCTTGCCATCCCAGTTATG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGGATCCTCATTAGTGCCTGCTGAACGACA-3′ (LR2006 OPY-1). We inserted XbaI and BamHI sites for cloning. We digested each fragment with XbaI/BamHI and inserted it into a eukaryotic expression vector, CMV/R14 (C-E37997, C-EOPY-1, E37997 and EOPY-1). The CMV/R vector comprises the human CMV IE enhancer/promoter, an HTLV-1 R region containing a splicing donor, a CMV IE splicing acceptor and bovine growth hormone poly A signal.","We created lentiviral vectors expressing glycoproteins from different CHIKV strains. The method for producing recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter gene has been previously described12,14. Briefly, we cotransfected 293T cells with 500 ng CHIKV E plasmid from either strain (E37997 or EOPY-1), 7 μg of a transducing vector encoding a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a CMV promoter (pHR’CMV-luciferase plasmid), and 7 μg of a packaging plasmid that expresses all human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) structural proteins except envelope (pCMVΔR8.2) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Additional methods and neutralization assay with CHIKV E pseudotyped lentiviral vectors are described in the Supplementary Methods.","We transfected 293F cells (2.5 × 108) (Invitrogen) with 293fectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and 125 μg of C-E37997 plasmid following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Detailed methods for buoyant density gradient analysis and purification of VLPs have been described in a previous publication32 and in the Supplementary Methods.","We flash-froze Chikungunya VLPs on holey grids in liquid ethane, and recorded images at 47K magnification with a CM300 FEG microscope with electron dose levels of approximately 20 e−/Å2. We digitized all micrographs at 6.35 μm per pixel using a Nikon scanner, and boxed individual particle images using the program e2boxer in the EMAN2 package33. We used the CTFIT program from the EMAN package34 to determine CTF parameters and flip phases. We constructed an initial model in EMAN using assigned 2-, 3-, and 5-fold views and refined it in EMAN assuming icosahedral symmetry. The number of particles incorporated into the final reconstruction was 1489, giving a final resolution of 18 Å based on a 0.5 Fourier shell correlation threshold.","We mixed 19 μg of VLPs (equivalent to approximately 10 μg of E1/E2) in 60 μl normal saline with 60 μl of Ribi solution (Sigma Adjuvant system, Sigma-Aldrich) per mouse. We injected female 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice in the right and left quadriceps muscles with VLPs in normal saline or Ribi in 120 μl total volume, two times at weeks 2 and 6. For DNA vaccination, we injected mice in the right and left quadriceps with a total of 15 μg of purified plasmid C-E37997, E37997, C-EOPY-1 or EOPY-1 suspended in 100 μl of normal saline three times at weeks 0, 3 and 6. Each group contained five mice. We collected sera and spleen 10 days after the last injection. In monkey experiments, we injected 3–4 year old rhesus macaques weighing 3–4 kg intramuscularly in the anterior quadriceps with either 20 μg of VLPs in 1 mL PBS (VLP group) or 1 mL PBS alone (control group) at weeks 0, 4 and 24. Each group contained six monkeys. To measure antibody titers, we collected blood on days −14, 0, 10, 28, 38, 56, 70, 161 and 178. We challenged the monkeys (n\u003d3 per group, randomly selected from each group) with 1010 PFU of CHIKV (strain LR2006 OPY-1) 15 weeks after the final immunization by intravenous injection. We collected blood to measure viremia at 0, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 hours, and sacrificed the monkeys 168 h after challenge. All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee, VRC, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/vrc) in accordance with relevant federal guidelines and regulations.","We used a HiTrap™ Protein G HP column (GE Healthcare) and a Melon Gel IgG Purification Kit (Pierce) for antibody purification. We dialyzed purified IgG three times against PBS. We administered 2 mg of purified IgG (from approximately 200 μl of serum) into each recipient IFN-α/βR-/- mouse by tail vein injection 24 h before challenge. The challenge consisted of 30 PFU of CHIKV (strain LR2006 OPY-1), administered by intradermal injection.","All results are expressed as means ± s.e.m. We analyzed the data with unpaired two-tailed t tests (Prism 5).","Additional methods are described in the Supplementary Methods."],"publishTime":"2010-01-28","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834826/"}
