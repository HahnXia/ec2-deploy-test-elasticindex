However, the outcome benefit shown through steroid administration in early septic shock implies this paranoia may be misplaced. We therefore performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the current strength of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in specified infections, and to make appropriate graded recommendations."],"authors":["Jody Aberdein","Mervyn Singer"],"bodyText":["Traditional teaching suggests that corticosteroids impair the ability of the body to fight infection and that this may prove catastrophic if an appropriate antibiotic is not chosen. In recent years, however, the early use of steroid therapy has become progressively established in a wide range of infective conditions [1,2], including septic shock, its most severe systemic manifestation. We thus decided to conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify the current strength of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in specified infections, and to make appropriate graded recommendations.","The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 1, 2005) were searched using medical subject headings (MeSH) for steroids, glucocorticoids, adrenal cortex hormones AND (virus diseases OR bacterial infections OR mycoses). In addition, phase 1 of the Cochrane highly sensitive strategy for randomised controlled trials [3] AND a steroid search (Table 1) AND search terms for specific clinical entities were utilised in both MEDLINE and EMBASE.","Systematic reviews published since 1999 formed the mainstay of analysis. Trials published more recently, or not considered by the reviews, were also included. For infections with no prior review, original articles are summarised. The abstracts thus obtained were scanned for relevance, and the original papers retrieved. Specific clinical entities are reviewed in order of the strength of evidence, proceeding through meta-analyses of multiple well-controlled trials to single small studies and case reports.","Table 2 shows the systems used to grade the level of evidence and consequent level of recommendation for the use of corticosteroids for each specified infection.","Low dose (200 to 300 mg) hydrocortisone equivalent/day for 7 days should be given to patients with a subnormal cortisol response (\u003c9 μg/l (248 nmol/l)) following 250 μg tetracosactrin.","Grade of evidence I; grade of recommendation B.","Hydrocortisone can be started pending the laboratory results and discontinued if the rise in cortisol level following 250 μg tetracosactrin exceeds 9 μg/l.","Grade of evidence I; grade of recommendation B.","After the seven day course, the dose of corticosteroid should be tailed off over a further five to seven days.","Grade of evidence IV; grade of recommendation E.","Dexamethasone 10 mg qds or equivalent should be given for 48 hours, preferably commencing prior to antibiotic therapy.","Grade of evidence I; grade of recommendation A.","Prednisolone 40 mg twice daily for 5 days, then 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg daily for 10 days should be given to adult patients with PaO2 \u003c9.3 kPa or alveolar-arterial gradient \u003e4.7 kPa.","Grade of evidence I; grade of recommendation A.","Hydrocortisone (200 mg bolus followed by 10 mg/h infusion for 7 days) may be considered in severe community-acquired pneumonia.","Grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.","Steroids cannot be recommended for treatment of SARS-related pneumonia.","Grade of evidence V; grade of recommendation E.","Steroids should not be used in children with bronchiolitis who are ventilated.","Grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.","Steroids should be given to children with mild bronchiolitis or viral wheeze who present as outpatients.

A more detailed consideration of the applicability of steroids can be found in some condition-specific reviews, many of which are cited above. The conditions we have covered range widely in severity, duration, site, and type of causative organism. Furthermore, the dosing and duration of steroid therapy varies enormously between conditions and, as clearly illustrated by steroid use in sepsis, benefit or harm may accrue depending on the regimen used. In many of the conditions listed, only limited data are available. There is an obvious need to have more adequately powered trials to provide definitive evidence of benefit or harm, and a better understanding of how steroids modulate disease processes.","CI \u003d confidence interval; EBV \u003d Epstein-Barr virus; FEV1 \u003d forced expiratory volume in 1 second; NNT \u003d number needed to treat; PaO2 \u003d arterial partial pressure of oxygen; RR \u003d relative risk; SARS \u003d severe acute respiratory syndrome.","The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."],"publishTime":"2005-11-22","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1550829/"}
