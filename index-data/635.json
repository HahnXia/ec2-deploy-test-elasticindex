UK emergency planning will be improved if planners have a better understanding of the reasons UK HCWs may have for their absenteeism, and what might motivate them to work during an influenza pandemic. This paper reports the results of a qualitative study that explored UK HCWs\u0027 views (n \u003d 64) about working during an influenza pandemic, in order to identify factors that might influence their willingness and ability to work and to identify potential sources of any perceived duty on HCWs to work. METHODS: A qualitative study, using focus groups (n \u003d 9) and interviews (n \u003d 5). RESULTS: HCWs across a range of roles and grades tended to feel motivated by a sense of obligation to work through an influenza pandemic. A number of significant barriers that may prevent them from doing so were also identified. Perceived barriers to the ability to work included being ill oneself, transport difficulties, and childcare responsibilities. Perceived barriers to the willingness to work included: prioritising the wellbeing of family members; a lack of trust in, and goodwill towards, the NHS; a lack of information about the risks and what is expected of them during the crisis; fear of litigation; and the feeling that employers do not take the needs of staff seriously. Barriers to ability and barriers to willingness, however, are difficult to separate out. CONCLUSION: Although our participants tended to feel a general obligation to work during an influenza pandemic, there are barriers to working, which, if generalisable, may significantly reduce the NHS workforce during a pandemic. The barriers identified are both barriers to willingness and to ability. This suggests that pandemic planning needs to take into account the possibility that staff may be absent for reasons beyond those currently anticipated in UK planning documents. In particular, staff who are physically able to attend work may nonetheless be unwilling to do so. Although there are some barriers that cannot be mitigated by employers (such as illness, transport infrastructure etc.), there are a number of remedial steps that can be taken to lesson the impact of others (providing accommodation, building reciprocity, provision of information and guidance etc). We suggest that barriers to working lie along an ability/willingness continuum, and that absenteeism may be reduced by taking steps to prevent barriers to willingness becoming perceived barriers to ability."],"authors":["Jonathan Ives","Sheila Greenfield","Jayne M Parry","Heather Draper","Christine Gratus","Judith I Petts","Tom Sorell","Sue Wilson"],"bodyText":["The World Health Organisation describes an influenza pandemic as an event in which \"a new influenza virus appears against which the human population has no immunity, resulting in several, simultaneous epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers of deaths and illness\" [1]. In the United Kingdom (UK) the Department of Health (DH) is forecasting that up to half of the population could become infected with up to 750,000 deaths under the reasonable worst case scenario [2]. These assumptions work on the basis of cumulative clinical attack rates of up to 50%; 4% of symptomatic patients requiring hospital admission; and a case fatality rate of 0.2 – 2.5% [2]. Even at the lower end of these estimates, an influenza pandemic will place the National Health Service (NHS) under severe strain, and it is clear from the recent National Risk Register [3] that it is regarded as a significant threat to national security in the UK.","Healthcare workers (HCWs) will play a key role in any response to pandemic influenza, and will be in the frontline of exposure to infection. UK planning assumes that once a pandemic is confirmed, the NHS will \"care for large numbers of cases, and will only provide essential care\" for other patients [2]. Recent guidance, based on an (unreferenced) survey tool, suggests that up to 50% of the workforce may be absent from work at the peak of the pandemic because of caring responsibilities [4]. A modelling summary submitted to the DH by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee Subgroup on Modelling estimates staff absenteeism at between 30–35% at the peak, taking into account the cumulative effect of staff illness, the need to look after ill children, and possible school closures [5].","It may not, however, be reasonable to assume that HCWs will be willing to work even if they are able to do so. For instance, during the early years of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic doctors debated whether it was ethically permissible to refuse to treat those with HIV [6-10]; and during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak some HCWs were not willing to treat SARS patients [11-13]. HIV and SARS provide reasonable comparators to pandemic influenza, and it is not unreasonable, therefore, to assume that the response to pandemic influenza may be similar.","The limited data on factors influencing HCWs\u0027 willingness to work highlight a sense of professional obligation, estimated risk to oneself and ones\u0027 family and inclusion in preparedness planning [14-16] Ehrenstein and colleagues [17] found 28% of German HCWs (physicians, final year medical students, nurses and administrators) may abandon work in favour of protecting themselves and family. Qureshi and colleagues [18] found the most significant barrier to US HCWs\u0027 willingness to work was fear for their own and their family\u0027s health. A survey of clinical and non-clinical HCWs in the US estimated that up to 50% would be unwilling to work, with clinical staff more likely to attend than non-clinical [19]. Research from Singapore suggests that the risks posed to self and to family would be significant concerns for primary care physicians [20], and a similar Australian study of general practitioners highlights a strong sense of obligation to work coexisting with concerns about being provided with protective equipment and the welfare of dependants [16]. It cannot be taken for granted that these studies can be applied to workers from other health services nor that the results of these studies can be used to inform their attempts to modify attitudes ahead of a pandemic. Different countries have different health care systems and different healthcare cultures. Given that healthcare culture is likely to have an impact upon the willingness of HCWs to work, it is important that culture specific research is conducted.","UK emergency planning, and consequently patient care, will be improved if it is possible to establish the factors associated with UK HCWs\u0027 willingness to work, and identify the motivations HCWs have for continuing to work. This study, therefore, aimed to explore UK NHS HCWs\u0027 views about working during an influenza pandemic, in order to identify factors that might influence their willingness and ability to work and potential sources of any perceived duty to work. The majority of work in this area to date has utilised survey tools, and whilst large scale surveys can provide important and generalisable information about people\u0027s views and the frequency of those views, it is also important that qualitative research is conducted to begin to build a picture of why those views are held. Given the aim of research on the attitudes of HCWs towards working during pandemic influenza is to enable us to predict and modify behaviour, it is important to have data that will help us understand the \u0027why?\u0027 as well as the \u0027what?\u0027 and \u0027how many?\u0027.","Participants were recruited from three NHS Trusts in the West Midlands, one acute teaching, one rural district general, and one Primary Care Trust.","NRES approval for this project was granted by Nottingham Research Ethics Committee 2 (Ref: 07/H0408/120), and R\u0026D approval was gained from each participating Trust.","Recruitment took place using advertisements via internal e-mail, through managers and snowballing (using key participants to recruit others). All participants approached by managers were made aware that participation was voluntary, and managers would not be told who had eventually participated. All potential participants who contacted the research team, regardless of how they had heard about the study, were sent an information sheet, and those who were willing to participate were entered on a database. Participants for focus groups were purposively selected from this database according to job category with a view to getting as wide a range of HCW roles as possible, including a mix of age, gender and seniority. Signed informed consent was gained from all participants prior to participation.","Ten focus groups were planned with volunteer HCWs (grouped according to homogeneity of role: ×2 ancillary and clerical (A1 \u0026 A2), ×2 nurses (N1 \u0026 N2), professions allied to medicine (P), junior doctors (below consultant – JD), consultants (C), general practitioners (GP), managers (M) and community based HCWs (CH). Failure to identify a suitable time for a consultant doctor group led to interviews (n \u003d 5) being undertaken with this category. Both focus groups and interviews followed a standardised topic guide, developed over a series of meetings of the authors and of the study steering committee. Open questions were used, enabling the content of the discussions, but not the form, to be participant led. The topic guide started by asking what participants knew about pandemic influenza, followed by questions about training and the effect they anticipated pandemic influenza to have on their work. Participants were asked if they felt they would be able to carry on \u0027business as usual as far as possible\u0027 [2] in their professional life; how likely they were to report to work if fit and well; whether they thought HCWs had a duty to work, why, and how far this duty extended. The discussions ended by asking participants to discuss the things that would worry them about working during an influenza pandemic, and what things they thought their employers, the Government, or professional bodies and unions could do to make it easier for them to work.","Focus groups are a recognised qualitative tool, suitable for research that aims to explore how people think and feel, where the emphasis is on exploring people\u0027s opinions, experiences, wishes and concerns [21,22] The dynamic, interactive, nature of focus groups means that participants are continually interacting with one another, exchanging views and perspectives, and this level of interaction enables the researcher to examine meanings, reasons and motivations \"with a degree of complexity that is not typically available with other methods\" (p16) [23] and to access the rich texture of normative influences on people\u0027s attitudes and behaviours [24]. The aim of a focus group is not to gather data that is statistically significant or generalisable to the wider population, but to gather information that can help us begin to understand why people may choose to act and behave in the way they do. For this reason, the results are not presented numerically, as in this context frequency has little meaning and detracts from the qualitative presentation style.","All focus groups/interviews were transcribed verbatim, and were formally reviewed by three of the authors (SG/JI/JMP). Transcripts were initially free-coded by JI on ATLAS-ti software according to content [25], and then organised into thematic units that were continually re-visited and revised. Analysis and data collection occurred simultaneously, with a constant comparative method [26] utilised to ensure an iterative approach to the interpretive project. Analytic induction [25] was also employed, with themes being identified, hypotheses generated and fed into subsequent groups/interviews and then revised in the light of new data.","Given the nature of qualitative enquiry, the analysis was not conducted numerically. \u0027Significance\u0027 in qualitative research, and particularly in a focus group, cannot be determined by the frequency with which a view or opinion is raised, but rather in the manner in which it is raised, discussed, and negotiated by the group. What is important in a focus group analysis is not how many people stated a particular view, but rather what general themes emerged out of the discussion [27]. Bowling [28] points out that \" [q]ualitative research describes in words rather than numbers\" (p352), and as such, we have presented our results by describing themes that tended to arise out of the group process, rather than counting the number of individuals who expressed a particular view. This is justified, first, because the number of participants (n \u003d 64) is insufficient to find any statistical significance. Second, our analysis focussed on what was said (the quality of views) rather than how often it was said (the quantity of views). What general frequency indicators are provided are given solely to give the reader an impression of whether the views under discussion were majority or minority views, and we have indicated in which groups the themes under discussion arose.","A different kind of study is needed to determine the prevalence of the views reported, and the qualitative data reported in this article have been used to develop a large scale survey tool, the work for which is ongoing [29]. This article only discusses our qualitative data, and focuses on the variety of views and perspectives present in our research population.","Overall, participants seemed to feel a strong sense of duty to work regardless of the circumstances and displayed a general willingness to work during an influenza pandemic. This sense of duty was found across all categories of workers, but was justified in a variety of ways that can be brought under three headings:","• a professional ethic","• a duty to help","• a work ethic and confederate loyalty","JI: So...what would you see as a source of this obligation to work, why would you personally feel that obligation to carry on? [long pause] It\u0027s a very tough question, I know.","C4: I suspect it must be something to do with the training, inherent to how it is being imparted. Now that\u0027s what I feel, I don\u0027t know what drives it to come to work, I suppose if I can come to work when I\u0027m fit and well without a pandemic around, I expect that if I\u0027m fit and well and I\u0027m expected to work, then if it\u0027s a pandemic I\u0027ll have to come and work.","JI: There\u0027s various ways of looking at healthcare workers duties and some people will argue that health workers have a duty to tend to the sick and do their job no matter what. Some people will extend that to just doctors, some to doctors and nurses, and some would extend to anybody including admin and secretarial staff. Would you feel that that kind of duty does exist and how far do you think it extends?","GP10: Doctors yes, nurses probably, reception staff","GP8: No.","GP10: That depends on the people you\u0027ve got. I think most of ours would turn up.","JI: What\u0027s the difference?","GP10: I just think it\u0027s the ethic. I mean you get into this job basically to look after people and, rather than man a phone for eight hours a day...","JD2: I think it\u0027s an obligation for doctors, I think that\u0027s set out by the GMC isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s the duty of a doctor.","JD5: It should be extended, I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s just my own opinion, it should be extended to everybody who comes in contact with the patient. Not only doctors, nurses as well","JD2: Well the hospital wouldn\u0027t function if it was just the doctors putting in the extra hours because you need support from the nursing staff, even down to the cleaning.","A1/9: I am agency staff but I don\u0027t feel any different. If I\u0027m of use then there\u0027s no point me sitting around redundant...when I can actually do something, It\u0027d be more frustrating for me to be sat at home because I can\u0027t work even though I can contribute, it would just feel counter productive.","*********************************","A1/2: I kind of feel about it the same way as if I saw somebody get knocked over by a car, I\u0027d go and help if I could.","A1/6: Yes, its human nature I think a lot of it.","A1/2: Yeah, that\u0027s the sort of way I feel about it. If there\u0027s something I could do, I would do it, you know. I think, I don\u0027t, I can\u0027t explain any more than that really, it\u0027s just that, you know","A1/5: And if you were in that situation you\u0027d hope somebody would help you, you know","A1/2: Well exactly and I think it\u0027s the good of human kind really, that you wanna help if you can","N1/5: We\u0027re British, Dunkirk spirit.","N1/3: Absolutely.","N1/5: And that has, bizarrely enough, that has been bandied around. You know that there are a lot of people that will just adopt this, well","N1/3: Spirit of the Blitz.","N1/5: Yeah, get on with it","CH4: I think it would depend on what help was required. If it was to administer medicines or injections, it\u0027s obvious which one would be needed more. If it was to sit there and just chat, support, wash then the nursing skills perhaps might be in use somewhere else so it\u0027s a really hard question to answer. I don\u0027t think you could just split it like that \u0027cause you\u0027d need to know more wouldn\u0027t you? [everyone nods]","A2/8: I mean personally, it don\u0027t matter what job I\u0027ve got, whatever job I sign up for I look into that field and carry it on and I get, try to get personal satisfaction out of it and part of this becomes a dedication of where I want to be and what I want to do and it\u0027s like I\u0027m now, I\u0027m in domestics now and that gets some of my attention so therefore it\u0027s spread into that. So I\u0027d come in anyway if I was all right, I would come in and that just ends it. Like if you had to do it anywhere else, you know you tend to go in because you think, \u0027Well someone else might be ill\u0027.","********************************************","JI: If you were fit and well during an Influenza pandemic, how likely do you think it is that you would work as normal?","C3: Yeah sure, it\u0027s part of the role.","JI: Yeah, so I mean can you expand on that by \u0027part of the role\u0027.","C3: Well that is part of what you do isn\u0027t it? You don\u0027t just work when the sun\u0027s shining.","*************************************************","HC3: You\u0027re not a nurse just when everything\u0027s okay, do you know what I mean? You\u0027re a nurse when things are not okay.","P4: I feel like that really I would be letting those patients down if I didn\u0027t come in because they\u0027re my raison d\u0027être, that\u0027s why I\u0027m here.","P1: It\u0027s not just your patients. It\u0027s your colleagues as well.","P5: Yeah.","P1: You\u0027re letting your team down as well as the patients.","P4: That\u0027s right.","***************************************************","N2/4: I think that\u0027s the other thing. It\u0027s camaraderie. You get like a good little team on a ward and half the time if you do feel a little bit sort of a little bit sick you think \u0027oh well I\u0027ve got to go in because they\u0027ll struggle without me\u0027.","Although all participants tended to feel they have a duty to work during an influenza pandemic, there were nonetheless a number of perceived barriers to so doing. These tended to fall into one of two categories:","• perceived barriers to ability (prominent in 9/9 focus groups and 5/5 interviews)","• perceived barriers to willingness (prominent in 9/9 focus groups and 5/5 interviews)","These categories, however, were not clear cut in all cases, and the lines were most blurred when it came to concerns about childcare and family obligation. Some participants who had children regarded staying at home to look after them as a necessity that affected their ability to work, rather than a choice (see below). Childcare is not, however, obviously distinguishable from a barrier to willingness; for instance, where parents choose to look after their children themselves rather than rely on available others to do so for them. Choice, of course, is itself a nebulous concept. Where there is no externally available or accessible childcare, and where children are too young to care for themselves, there is a barrier to ability. However, what counts as \u0027accessible\u0027 or \u0027too young\u0027 and whether the available childcare is regarded as an adequate or acceptable alternative may owe as much to personal choice or preference as to inescapable circumstance.","It seems likely that the \u0027childcare\u0027 barrier is age and gender related. Women with young children tended to regard it as an insurmountable obstacle, with men raising the issue less often. Whether this gender difference was due to the participants\u0027 need to present themselves to their peers as participating in typical gender roles is unclear, although the discrepancy observed is predictable, and consistent with what we might expect. The group in which it was least prominent was the GP group, which was comprised largely of older men. The discussion was most prominent in the nursing groups, where women with young children were in the majority. The apparent lack of concern about this issue in the GP group may reflect gendered norms in the home, the age of the participants which meant that they were unlikely to have young children, or that GPs were better placed to afford reliable, private childcare. Similarly, the junior doctors did not discuss this issue: it was raised in passing only once. When they were questioned about why it had not been discussed, the answer was simply that they did not have children so it was not an issue.","For some, the duty to family was expressed as the simple claim that \u0027family comes first\u0027 which was taken for granted as an unassailable moral premise. If a child or a family member needed them they would not come into work pandemic or no pandemic: duties to families were more important than any duty to work. This was not so much a matter of weighing up competing obligations (to work and to family) but rather represented a pre-defined moral hierarchy acting as a barrier to ability (see below). For others, childcare functioned as a barrier to willingness, where a choice puts family before work.","Some barriers to ability were fairly concrete like being ill oneself and problems with transport (including lack of fuel). Participants recognised that they could not work if incapacitated by illness, and also anticipated that in the event of an influenza pandemic transport infrastructures might be affected, making it difficult to travel to work. Some participants thought that during an influenza pandemic people might be reluctant to use public transport for fear of becoming infected, leading to more people travelling to work in private cars. These same participants anticipated that Trusts would not have the parking space to accommodate additional demand, creating a further barrier for people who would otherwise be willing and able to work (see below). Insurmountable barriers to ability, however, exist at the extreme end of a continuum; for example where a person is literally too ill to get out of bed or function safely, where the person is infectious and poses a demonstrable risk to others, or where there is no fuel at all and the distance to work is too great to cover on foot or cycle. Further along this continuum, HCWs will be exercising choice about how to prioritise the different demands on their time and resources, and the greater the scope for preference or choice to be exercised, the more like a barrier to willingness the perceived obstacle becomes.","N2/1: But it\u0027s not just people with children, it\u0027s people with old parents or you know it\u0027s home situations isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s family situations and family comes before anything.","A1/2: I think there\u0027s a Government issue as well like, you know for example if I come on, I come to work on the train, if the trains were all down because there\u0027s no staff to run them or whatever and I have to come to work in my car, um where do I park, um, and then you, I mean the icing on the cake would be if you parked up, they just said park anywhere and then get a bloomin\u0027 ticket from Q-park","******************************************************","JI: What kind of effect do you think that Pandemic Influenza would have your work place and on your job?","C1: I think I would see it in two ways, one is if I\u0027m personally myself infected, and affected then it would have an implication from the point of view of my ability to work, and if it\u0027s going to be infectious then clearly there\u0027s going to be the issue of isolation. So if I\u0027m infected and if I\u0027m isolated then I wouldn\u0027t be able to work. If I\u0027m not infected and I need to come to work it would pose a question in my mind whether I\u0027m going to get infected if I come to work.","GP5: So if it is that there is a substantial risk that you yourself may succumb which sort of people might not be too concerned about their own mortality but the young children and dependents might be more of a concern. Then you\u0027d want to make sure that if you\u0027re gonna put yourself in the front line then it\u0027s something worth doing. So there\u0027s no point, there\u0027s no point and if you\u0027re gonna be there you ought to be very well co-ordinated nationally and so you know what you\u0027re doing. Get as much protection as you can.","JI: Would that, do you think, be a requirement of your going into work, or would you go in anyway?","GP5: I think most of us would go in, even me who\u0027s raising all these concerns, I think most of us would go in, but there\u0027s a little bit of me that says that I\u0027d tell you on the day.","GP3: I think if it was gonna kill you, you know sort of people, you know sort of healthy people or you know in their sort of thirties or whatever like me supposedly, yeah it would be nice to think you were gonna have some sort of protection, some sort of pull them down type fancy mask and yeah I might sort of sleep in the shed rather than give it to my daughter, but yeah.","JI: So people have said \u0027Well it\u0027s not me I\u0027m worried about, it\u0027s taking it home to my children\u0027. I think given what you\u0027ve said, that\u0027s not going to be a concern for you?","C2: Well I mean that seems ridiculous to me, I mean I just think the whole point about a pandemic is it affects the whole herd, the whole tribe and why should I worry about taking it home when they\u0027re more likely to catch it from school or shopping or, and I don\u0027t know whether that\u0027s right but that\u0027s the way I\u0027ve always looked at it really...I think it\u0027s probably a false assumption that you\u0027re gonna keep them safe by not going to work.","GP2: Okay, can I be honest? If there was an outbreak I don\u0027t think I\u0027d come in...If I put my life and my family\u0027s life at risk it\u0027s easier to say you would come in but then when you see your colleagues dying I think it\u0027s a different thing if you\u0027re taking it back to your family because you love them don\u0027t you, and I don\u0027t think if there was an outbreak and I saw my colleagues really sick on death\u0027s door that I\u0027d want to be coming into work and putting my husband and my family at risk. I just don\u0027t think I could do it.","N2/4: I think as well being aware of um showing, you know, how they use those paper masks in theatre whether that would be an effective barrier against it or whether you\u0027d need something sort of","N2/3: The proper equipment, rather than a cheaper alternative which they tend to do don\u0027t they as well? Proper equipment would be best","N2/6: Yeah, what protection are the staff that\u0027s coming to work going to have against catching it from the patients?","N1/1: It\u0027s giving people information as well, if you\u0027re more informed about something you\u0027re more likely to do it than if you get up and you\u0027re not told anything, why should I put myself at risk if I don\u0027t have all of the information?","M6: I think one of the difficulties is that there was a lot of changes initially in the national guidance on what could be expected, and there was a reluctance to pass that information down and then have to review it, and you know that affects the creditability of the information they\u0027re receiving","M3: but it\u0027s still very difficult given that we don\u0027t know when or what to give information. And if you think about giving information down to that level, it so rarely gets down there that if you got it down there now and it was wrong you\u0027d have very great difficulty changing it when you need it to be right. So it\u0027s not about keeping ignorant, it\u0027s about informing people when you know. And it would be, I think it would be very wrong to give detailed guidance when we don\u0027t know what we\u0027re or what, you know, what the dangers are. But we\u0027ve got to have a system in place to give guidance in an authoritative manner when the time comes.","Both clinical and non-clinical participants were worried about being asked to perform a role they had not been trained for, and had concerns both about being a danger to patients and being subject to litigation if something went wrong. Participants tended to feel they would need more support than usual from their managers (to help them to make decisions, to fight their corner, and to give hands-on assistance). There was also a belief, however, that there would be less support during a pandemic. It was clear that many participants would be reluctant to take on extended roles without some assurance that they would be protected from litigation and without explicit guidance on how to negotiate the ethical dilemmas that the pandemic was likely to produce (see below).","A2/8: One thing that crossed my mind, is if I\u0027m called in to help, clinical-wise and I make a gaffe, and the relatives take me to court who\u0027s gonna protect me? And it\u0027ll make me decide whether I was gonna help or not really.","*********************************************","N1/5: There isn\u0027t enough, from what the Critical Care Community, are saying coming out of the Department of Health to reassure them and there\u0027s a big fear amongst medical staff that you know, two years down the line they\u0027ll be litigated against because they rationed and denied services to people because there weren\u0027t enough beds or because they chose one patient over another. And these are genuine concerns that are being expressed by nursing staff alone.","CH1: Well who would get the vaccination, how would you choose?","CH5: I guess the consultant makes the decision who gets it and who doesn\u0027t.","CH3: So selection, like Auschwitz isn\u0027t it?","CH1: I wouldn\u0027t like to be...","CH?: That would be awful wouldn\u0027t it","CH5: I wouldn\u0027t like to think they\u0027d think it would be left up to me......as an administrator...","CH4: Who you prioritise and deny people as well","CH5: I would be very reluctant to go anywhere without proper guidelines, because that would stay on your conscience forever wouldn\u0027t it.","P6: It is, it is a different decision for everybody but I think, personally I would be... I\u0027d feel obliged to come in anyway professionally but I would like to know that the Trust doesn\u0027t – how shall I put this? – I would like to know that the Trust can rely on me but at the same time I can rely on the Trust to make sure of my safety...Because I\u0027d feel obliged to come in and I will come in but they\u0027ve got to make sure that they go the full mile as well.","A further, connected, issue was that of the general erosion of morale and goodwill in the NHS as a whole. This was connected to the previously mentioned expectation that the HCWs\u0027 role during a pandemic would not be appreciated, recognised or rewarded. Some participants believed that NHS staff generally felt so under-valued and under-appreciated that some would be unlikely to report for work if they thought they were at personal risk. The majority seemed to feel that, in a crisis, their sense of obligation to their patients or colleagues would overcome their generally low morale, but anticipated that many of their colleagues would not feel the same way (see below).","A1/8: If they just show they\u0027re grateful for what you did. Say if a patient says to me, \u0027Oh you\u0027ve kept my room spotless while I\u0027ve been in here\u0027, it gives me a boost to think I\u0027ve done something, but when you don\u0027t get no credit, then that\u0027s a knock back to you. That\u0027s when morale goes down.","A1/5: Is it a matter of esteem as well isn\u0027t it, you know?","A1/1: Come the end of the pandemic you\u0027ve kept your bone marrow transplant ward isolated, clean and none of the patients have come down with the flu or whatever it is, and everything goes in the paper and you don\u0027t get a single mention that\u0027s gonna be soul destroying","N2/4: I think for years now a lot of the NHS has run on goodwill of nurses and I think that bit by bit, especially the Trust where I come from...that\u0027s why I left there, the goodwill was eroded...","N2/1: They beat it out of you don\u0027t they? ...You\u0027re right. They do! They badger you and badger you until...I mean it\u0027s a caring profession. It\u0027s not a job you do for the money. It\u0027s a job you do because you want to do it but there is a limit...","CH5: I mean I could probably split my staff in two camps, of the administration camp there\u0027s those I know would be there and they\u0027d give their time and those that would say \u0027Sorry, no\u0027. And that\u0027s just because of the people that they are and then the other obligations that they have.","The NHS staff in our study, across all roles and professions, tended to believe that they should, and would, work through an influenza pandemic. There was a widespread belief that they had a duty to work, and that in not continuing to work they would be doing something morally wrong. The basis for this sense of duty varied from group to group. Some were motivated by a sense of professional obligation; some by a general duty to help those in need; and others by a work ethic or feelings of confederate loyalty","Despite this, there were also barriers to working that impacted on this sense of duty, prominent amongst which were the need to care for/protect dependents and lack of information, guidance and support. These can be either barriers to ability or barriers to willingness, although the two are not always readily distinguishable. Most barriers seem to form a continuum with preference at one end and insurmountable circumstance at the other with increasingly difficult choices in the middle. The harder the choice, the more likely it is to be perceived as a barrier to ability; for instance, choosing to walk into work will be easier if it takes half an hour and if one is relatively used to exercise than if it takes an hour and a half and one is not. In the latter case, the absence of motorised transportation is more likely to be perceived as a barrier to ability. Equally, it would be wrong to assume, however, that it is always possible in practice to make a choice that is present in principle; a position that fails to appreciate the impact of inflexible external constraints and social circumstances. A decision to work (or not to work) is likely to be the result of a combination of motivations and beliefs, which interact with both genuine and constructed barriers to ability. For some, this combination may result in a genuine barrier to ability or a barrier to willingness that is genuinely perceived as a barrier to ability, and for others simply a barrier to willingness.","Which of these motivations, and which of these barriers, proves to be the most significant in the event of an influenza pandemic is something that can only be known and understood after the event. The barriers to, and motivations for, working, however, that we have identified may suggest forms of remedial action if these barriers and motivations are found to be prevalent in the workforce. The key to the efficacy of this remedial action may be to effect changes that prevent barriers to willingness from becoming insurmountable barriers to ability. If HCWs are concerned about infecting their families then steps might be taken to minimise this risk. Similarly, if transport is a likely issue steps might be taken to facilitate transport to and from work. Ensuring that staff are protected from litigation, and ensuring that they know they are protected, may also remove a barrier to taking on extended roles. This seems to be in line with DH guidance that staff should be provided with appropriate indemnity [30], although the definition of negligence found in the DH Human Resources guidance implies that no special protections will be given to staff working in extended roles in an emergency situation [4]. If we are correct in hypothesising that many barriers to working lie along an ability/willingness continuum, the key to effective mitigation is likely to be taking steps to tip the scale so that more barriers than not are experienced as barriers to willingness – which are more negotiable than barriers to ability. This will at least ensure that more HCWs than not feel they are in a position where working is an option for them.","One concern prominant in all groups (with the exception of the doctors and managers – who seemed to feel they knew what they supposed to do) was that participants felt they were not being told what was expected of them. If this is a widespread problem, one effective strategy (and one already indicated in DH planning guidance [30]) may be to have a policy of education and communicating emergency plans to staff, outlining what is known, what is not known, and what is expected of them. If Trusts are concerned about disseminating information before all the facts are known, then a policy of \u0027explicit uncertainty\u0027 might be adopted. The key point is that HCWs may not necessarily expect to be told all the answers, but they want to be kept in the loop and to be reassured that when information becomes available it will be communicated to them. Simply ensuring that systems are in place for the dissemination of information when it becomes available is not enough. The existence of these systems may have to be more effectively communicated to encourage the feeling that the needs of workers are being acknowledged. Our data suggests that giving workers evidence in the pre-pandemic phase that goodwill expended by them during a pandemic will be reciprocated by employers will encourage that expenditure. Reciprocity was identified as a key factor in the ethical guidance published by the DH [31], and this study reinforces its significance – suggesting that reciprocity is not just an ethical concern, but also a very practical one. Building goodwill amongst staff and encouraging confederate loyalty is likely to be an effective strategy to increase the motivation to work amongst HCWs. This is, however, no small task and it is unlikely that simply telling staff they are needed and are appreciated will be effective. A more promising avenue may be to encourage team cohesion in small units. It has been observed that soldiers on active duty may be motivated more by feelings of in-group loyalty than by a commitment to abstract ideals [32] (although a causal link between team cohesion and effectiveness/performance has been challenged [33]). It seems likely that similar team motivations may be at work with HCWs. Feelings of team cohesion may not enhance an HCW\u0027s effectiveness, but it may deter absenteeism.","A significant strength of this study is that participants were sampled from three different NHS settings across a wide variety of roles, and yet the overarching themes were consistent across groups. The findings also concord with previous work conducted overseas, showing some resonance with the findings of both Qureshi et al [18] and Ehrenstein et al [17] insofar as the perceived risks to family and children were very prominent. As one reviewer of this article pointed out, this suggests that barriers to working may be similar across some nations, and indicates there may be some benefit to the international sharing of strategies for dealing with HCW absenteeism.","An obvious limitation to these findings is responder bias. Participants in a focus group or interview may be the type of people who are already motivated and interested, or feel strongly about the topic area. Since it is likely that such individuals would be more willing to work during an influenza pandemic, our results may overstate HCWs\u0027 willingness to work. Another limitation to this study is the responder bias towards people identifying themselves as \u0027white British\u0027. Further work, focussing on minority groups, may be required if there is reason to think that the views of white British people are likely to be different to those of other ethnic groups. However, a specific analysis looking at the views of our non-\u0027white British\u0027 participants showed that no such difference was visible within our focus groups.","This study attempted neither to provide estimates of the proportion of NHS staff who may work in the event on an influenza pandemic nor to predict the characteristics of such staff, though this work is ongoing [29]. It does, however, suggest that although UK HCWs may feel a general obligation to work during an influenza pandemic, there are a number of possible barriers to working that may significantly reduce the workforce of the NHS at such a time. Some of these barriers may be insurmountable but others may not. Relatively simple steps could be taken that might increase the likelihood of HCWs being willing and able to continue to work.","Current UK planning [4] assumes that up to 50% of the NHS workforce may require time off at the peak of a pandemic. Given that this level of absenteeism is likely to cause significant problems for a health service already in crisis, it is important that every means of encouraging HCWs to work if they are able are identified. The data presented in this article suggests a number of factors that may affect HCW\u0027s willingness to work. Further, if, as we suggest, factors affecting ability and willingness lie along a continuum, it will be important to take measures to prevent barriers to willingness becoming perceived barriers to ability. Where barriers to working are based on deeply held moral values – such as that of putting family or more specifically children first – such barriers may prove as insurmountable as being too ill to work. More effective might be efforts to ensure that wherever HCWs feel that a choice to work or not is necessary or possible they are inclined to choose in favour of working. They are more likely to be so inclined if they continue to perceive whatever barrier gave rise to the choice as one of willingness rather than ability. Based on our focus groups with UK HCWs, we have suggested a number of possible measures that may achieve this which include providing transport, accommodation and useful and timely information to staff as well as demonstrating to them that they are needed and valued. These, or similar, measures may encourage the view that choosing to work is a realistic and acceptable option. If people feel they have no choice but to stay away, they will stay away. If people find that there are no concrete barriers that effectively prevent them from being able to work, they have to make the choice for themselves, and where this choice is available other factors such as perceptions of duty (however conceived), peer pressure, or the knowledge that they will be supported and thanked may provide the motivation to make the choice in favour of working.","HCW(s): Health Care Worker(s); DH: Department of Health; WHO: World Health Organisation; NRES: National Research Ethics Service; NHS: National Health Service.","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","All authors were involved in the design of the project.
